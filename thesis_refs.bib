   abstract = {Health monitoring and its related technologies is an attractive research area. The electrocardiogram (ECG) has always been a popular measurement scheme to assess and diagnose cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The number of ECG monitoring systems in the literature is expanding exponentially. Hence, it is very hard for researchers and healthcare experts to choose, compare, and evaluate systems that serve their needs and fulfill the monitoring requirements. This accentuates the need for a verified reference guiding the design, classification, and analysis of ECG monitoring systems, serving both researchers and professionals in the field. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive, expert-verified taxonomy of ECG monitoring systems and conduct an extensive, systematic review of the literature. This provides evidence-based support for critically understanding ECG monitoring systems’ components, contexts, features, and challenges. Hence, a generic architectural model for ECG monitoring systems is proposed, an extensive analysis of ECG monitoring systems’ value chain is conducted, and a thorough review of the relevant literature, classified against the experts’ taxonomy, is presented, highlighting challenges and current trends. Finally, we identify key challenges and emphasize the importance of smart monitoring systems that leverage new technologies, including deep learning, artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT), to provide efficient, cost-aware, and fully connected monitoring systems.},

abstract = {ECG monitoring is common place in the hospital and even pre-hospital setting. The need for different types of lead systems in different settings has been emphasised. Simple three electrode bipolar recording is ubiquitous for monitoring. This can be used to record modified bipolar chest leads as well. Using five leads gives the option of getting a chest lead in addition to bipolar limb leads, enhancing detection of ischemia during procedures. Lead stability is important when the movement of the subject is maximum as in exercise testing. Mason-Likar modification with limb leads shifted to the torso is popular for exercise testing, though the diagnostic value of the ECG is altered. Lund system with leads on proximal part of limbs have both stability and fair diagnostic value. EASI lead system permits derivation of 12 leads from just five electrodes. Lewis lead and the newly devised modified limb lead system are useful in enhancing detection of atrial activity. Fontaine lead has been designed to improve visualization of Epsilon wave in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia.}

@article{Zywietz1990,
   abstract = {An important feature of an ECG analysis program is its ability to provide reliable measurements under various operating conditions, e.g., on noise-free and noisy ECGs. Therefore, within the European cooperative project "Common Standards For Quantitative Electrocardiography" (CSE), the accuracy and stability of ECG measurements obtained by several computer programs has been compared. To investigate the stability of measurements two sets of 10 ECGs with and without seven different high- and low-frequency types of noise-altogether 160 electrocardiograms and 160 vectorcardiograms-have been analyzed by eight electrocardiographic and five vectorcardiographic computer programs. The stability of measurement was tested with respect to results obtained for the noise-free recordings. In a previous paper, the influence of noise on wave boundary recognition has been reported. In the present paper, the effect of noise on amplitude measurements and on problems of waveform definitions within the QRS complex are described. The results indicate that programs analyzing an averaged beat exhibit less variability than programs which measure every complex or a selected beat. Comparability and stability of measurements could be improved if a standardized procedure for amplitude references were to be introduced. In addition, the stability of QRS waveform labelling could be improved if waveforms' minimum amplitude and duration were to be validated against the noise level which itself should be determined by a standardized procedure. © 1990.},

   abstract = {There are various ways a computer can detect QRS complexes, all of which depend on two main factors-the algorithm, and the data. In practice, doctors can pinpoint patient's R-peaks in an electrocardiogram by analyzing the complex morphology of the ECG signal; computers accomplish the same by utilizing different QRS detection algorithms. In this paper, we address the data problem to select the sample rate and resolution that obtain the highest accuracy. For this purpose, we conduct experiments to find the impact of the sampling frequency and resolution on the quality of the QRS detection, by several open-source QRS detection algorithms with multiple variations of data representation. The final goal is to recommend the lowest sampling frequency and smallest sampling resolution (bit depth), that will have sufficient data representation to enable high QRS detection accuracy.},

   abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are heart and blood vessels diseases with considerable morbidity and mortality and presenting worldwide public health burden, moreover CVDs are the leading cause of death globally. This paper describes a novel bio-system reliability approach, particularly suitable for multi-regional environmental and health systems, observed over a sufficient period of time, resulting in a reliable long-term forecast of cardiovascular diseases mortality probability. Objective has been to determine extreme cardiovascular diseases death rate probability at any time in any region of interest. Traditional statistical methods dealing with temporal observations of multi-regional processes do not have the advantage of dealing efficiently with extensive regional dimensionality and cross-correlation between different regional observations. Design of this analysis was based on applying novel statistical methods directly to a raw clinical data, with subsequent data analysis using multicenter, population-based, medical survey data based bio-statistical approach. For this study, cardiovascular diseases annual numbers of recorded deaths in all 195 world countries were chosen. The suggested methodology can be used in various public health applications, based on their clinical survey data.},

   abstract = {Availability of low-cost, reliable, and portable Electrocardiography (ECG) devices is still very important in the medical world today. Despite the tremendous technological advancement, Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) remain a serious health burden claiming millions of lives on an annual basis globally. This is more prevalent in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) where there are huge financial instability and lack of critical infrastructure and support services for the health care system. Efforts aimed at reducing the prevalence of CVDs are confounded by late diagnosis, frequently, caused by lack of access to or non-availability of basic diagnostic modalities such as the ECG. Hence effective mitigation of the effect of CVDs in LMICs depend on the development of such devices at low-cost with reliability, accuracy and energy efficiency. This paper therefore, was developed to understand the state of the art of low-cost ECG acquisition systems with respect to design features and system capabilities for different use cases. In addition, different design options and taxonomies of available low-cost ECG devices, case studies reports of efficacy tests have been provided. The paper proposes a generalised ECG framework and provides implementation challenges and open research directions that should be considered when developing such devices for proper management of CVDs.},
